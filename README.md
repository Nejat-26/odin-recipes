# odin-recipes

This is a basic HTML project. It's a simple recipe website built using only HTML.

## Features
- Homepage with links to recipes
- Three recipe pages: Doro Wot, Atkilt Wot, and Tibs
- Each recipe includes:
    - Image of the dish
    - Description
    - Ingredients list
    - Cooking steps
    - Link back to homepage

## What I learned

- Basic HTML structure and tags
- Linking between pages and images
- Organizing files in folders
- Using git and Github to track changes
- creating repository and linking it to git by myself

## Reflection

-  I learned the importance of paying attention to my current directory when staging and committing files with Git.
- I realized that opening HTML files from VS Code while using the WSL terminal doesn’t always work as expected, because it tries to use Linux paths that don’t open properly in a Windows browser.
