   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Doro Wot is a rich and spicy Ethiopian chicken stew traditionally made with chicken, onions, berbere spice, and niter kibbeh (spiced clarified butter). It is often considered Ethiopia’s national dish and is commonly served on special occasions and holidays. The stew is deeply flavorful due to the slow-cooked onions and complex spices, and it’s typically served with injera, a sour flatbread used to scoop up the dish.</p>
   <p>What makes Doro Wot special is its combination of bold spices and comforting textures. The hard-boiled eggs added at the end soak up the intense flavor of the stew, making every bite satisfying and unique.</p>
  <h2>Ingredients</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>2 pounds of chicken (drumsticks or thighs, skin removed)</li>
    <li>2 cups finely chopped red onions</li>
    <li>¼ cup niter kibbeh (Ethiopian spiced butter) or regular butter</li>
    <li>2 tablespoons berbere spice blend</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced garlic</li>
    <li>1 tablespoon minced fresh ginger</li>
    <li>Salt to taste</li>
    <li>4 hard-boiled eggs, peeled</li>
    <li>Water or chicken broth (as needed)</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>Steps</h2>
  <ol>
    <li>In a large pot, dry-cook the chopped onions over medium heat (no oil) for about 20–30 minutes, stirring frequently until they become soft and caramelized.</li>
    <li>Add the niter kibbeh, garlic, ginger, and berbere spice. Cook for 5–10 minutes until everything is well combined and fragrant.</li>
     <li>Add the chicken pieces to the pot and stir well to coat them in the onion-spice mixture.</li>
    <li>Pour in enough water or broth to cover the chicken about halfway. Cover and simmer over low heat for 45–60 minutes, stirring occasionally.</li>
     <li>Add the hard-boiled eggs to the stew and continue to simmer for another 10 minutes, allowing them to absorb the flavor.</li>
    <li>Serve hot with Injera or rice.</li>
  </ol>
