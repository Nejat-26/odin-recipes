   <h2>Description</h2>
   <p>Atkilt Wot is a hearty, comforting vegan dish made with cabbage, carrots, and potatoes slowly stewed with aromatic spices. It's often served during fasting days when animal products are avoided. The vegetables are gently cooked with turmeric, garlic, and onions in oil, creating a mildly spiced and fragrant stew.</p>
